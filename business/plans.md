# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Research & Prototyping
- Design and construction of the first working spectrometer.
- Proof-of-concept demonstrations to validate Raman-based nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate detection.
- Early testing in both lab and field conditions.
- Data collection to build the foundation for commercial models.

## Phase 2: Commercialization

### Phase 2a: Core Model
- Launch of Spectril Green (532 nm): cost-effective, accessible entry model.
- Production scaling to hundreds of units depending on demand.
- Sales from early units reinvested into R&D for advanced systems.

### Phase 2b: Red Model
- Launch of Spectril Red (785 nm): enhanced model optimized for organics and biological samples.
- Establishment of field trials with conservation groups, labs, and regulatory agencies.


### Phase 2c: Pro Model
- Launch of Spectril Pro: high-end model with remote Raman spectrography (up to 5 meters), integrated microscope, and additional water-quality sensors (DO, pH, conductivity, TDS).
- Exploration of modular sensor expansion and future wavelengths beyond 785 nm.

### Shared Features Across All Models
- Raman spectrography for pollutants (nitrates, sulfates, phosphates, cyanides, halides, organics,microplastics, and more).
- GPS tracking for precise sample logging.
- Portable design for lab and field use.
- Open API for integration with third-party analytics.

## Phase 3: Maintenance & Support
Ongoing customer support, documentation, and software updates.
Long-term service contracts for organizations and research teams.
Expansion of applications through firmware upgrades and accessory modules.
Building a user community to share datasets and best practices.
